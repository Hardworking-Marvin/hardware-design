upgrade_ip

Description: 
Upgrade a configurable IP to a later version

Syntax: 
upgrade_ip  [-srcset <arg>] [-vlnv <arg>] [-log <arg>] [-quiet] [-verbose]
            <objects>...

Returns: 
A return code indicating success or failure.

Usage: 
  Name        Description
  -----------------------
  [-srcset]   (Optional) Specifies the source file set containing the IP to 
              be upgraded
              Default: The current source fileset
              Values: Source set name
  [-vlnv]     (Optional) Identifies the Catalog IP to which the IP will be 
              upgraded. The VLNV string maps to the IPDEF property on the IP 
              core. This is a strict comparison, and the upgrade will fail if
              the identified IP does not exist in the Catalog.
              Default: Latest version of the current IP
              Values: A string of the form '<vendor>:<library>:<name>:<versio
              n>'
  [-log]      (Optional) Identifies the log file to which the IP upgrade 
              report will be concatenated. 
              Default: An empty string, indicating that no log will be 
              written
              Values: A file path to an existing writable file, or a 
              non-existent file location in a writable directory
  [-quiet]    Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]  Suspend message limits during command execution
  <objects>   IP to be upgraded
              Values: IP instance(s) within the design, as returned by 
              'get_ips <instance name>' or 'get_bd_cells <cell name>'

Categories: 
IPFlow

Description:

  This command upgrades the specified IP cores from an older version to the
  latest version in the IP catalog.

  You can only upgrade IP that explicitly supports upgrading. The
  UPGRADE_VERSIONS property on the ipdef object indicates if there are
  upgrade versions for an IP core.

  Note: The upgrade_ip command also accepts Block Design cell IP instances as
  bd_cell objects. The command upgrades the bd_cell objects within the Block
  Design, and does not require the diagram to be open in the Vivado IP
  integrator .

Arguments:

  -srcset <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the source file set to upgrade the IP
  files in. If not specified, the default source file set is sources_1.

  -vlnv <arg> - (Optional) Specify the Vendor:Library:Name:Version attribute
  of the IP to upgrade from the IP catalog. The VLNV attribute identifies the
  object in the IP catalog.

  -log <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of a file to append the IP
  upgrade information to. By default the upgrade_ip command does not log its
  activities.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the log file
  will be written into the current project directory.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) Specifies which IP cores of Block Design cells to
  upgrade. The IP must be specified as objects returned by the get_ips
  command.

  Note: Do not use the get_ips -all option, as this can result in recursion
  issues.

Examples:

  The following example upgrades all IP cores in the current project to the
  latest version:

    upgrade_ip [get_ips]
